#Finite-State-Machine-Online
===========================
##What is it?
===========================
*Finite State Machine Online* is a web application developed for use by developers and students to quickly create [finite automatons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) without the burden of paying for bloated software.  It serves one purpose, creating state machines.

**Well that seems great...but...what then?**
Lets just take a look at the features ;)


===========================
##Features
===========================
- Create state machines quickly using mouse and keyboard commands (i.e., no drag n' drop)
- Using the *Navigation Map*, you can zoom or pan over your graph (works...but still under development)
- Labeling of *states* and *transitions* is done seemlessly and you may even use special character combinations for *greek* characters (e.g., /lambda inserts lambda character...go regex!)
- Graphs may be exported to PNG


===========================
##Upcomming Features
===========================
- Import/Export JSON representation of graphs (this is helpful for users implementing state machines in JavaScript)
- Advanced graph tools
  - Graph Auto Sizing
  
===========================
##Server Support
===========================
Included in the source code is instructions for setting up a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) server to save/load your graphs to/from.  This will also hook into the NoSQL database, [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/).


##*Installation instructions comming soon!*
